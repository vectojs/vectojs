Fix choppy/stepped motion for any in-flight `setTransition`/`animateTo`/`springTo` animation in the default `always` render mode: `Entity.hasPendingAnimations()` didn't check active property drivers, so once Scene's idle auto-throttle engaged, an animation only advanced one frame per external `markDirty()` call instead of every render frame (a `markDirty()` called from inside `update()` is wiped by the loop's own `dirty = false` at the end of that same tick — only `hasPendingAnimations()` reliably holds the throttle off across frames).

`ScrollView` is refactored to drive its content's scroll offset through this shared, dt-aware spring system instead of a hand-rolled, frame-rate-dependent integrator, fixing both the throttle-invisibility and the dt-independence in one pass. This is most visible in the AI Chat demo, where scrolling now glides continuously alongside token-by-token streaming instead of stepping in bursts synchronized to token arrival.
