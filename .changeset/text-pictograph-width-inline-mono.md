Two text-correctness fixes.

**Text-default pictographs no longer count as double-width** (`@vectojs/text`). `PreparedContentGrid`'s `isWideCluster` treated every `Extended_Pictographic` code point as width-2, but `© ® ™ ☺ ✔ ❤` (and many others) are _text-default_ — width-1 unless an emoji variation selector (VS16) forces emoji presentation. This drifted the caret in the monospace content grid. A pictograph is now wide only when it carries VS16 or is `Emoji_Presentation` by default (and VS15 forces it narrow); flags, keycaps, and CJK are unaffected.

**Inline `code` now renders (and measures) as monospace** (`@vectojs/layout`, `@vectojs/ui`, `@vectojs/markdown`). `TextStyle` gains an optional `fontFamily`, and `GlyphMeasurer.measure` gains an optional `fontFamily` argument, so a run in a different family lays out at its own metrics instead of the base font's. `RichText` honors it in both drawing (`nodeFont`) and measurement, and Markdown inline `codespan` now sets `fontFamily` to the theme's monospace stack — previously inline code was only tinted, rendered in the proportional prose font. Fenced `CodeBlock` was already monospace and is unchanged. Runs without `fontFamily` keep the component's base family (no behavior change for existing callers).
