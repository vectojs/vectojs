Complete the lifecycle-leak teardown on the `destroy()` path (follow-up to the `Entity.destroy()` recursion fix):

- **MSDF worker slot**: `MSDFTextEntity.destroy()` now cancels its queued layout via a new static `LayoutWorkerManager.cancelLayoutForEntity(id)` that no-ops when no manager exists, instead of `getInstance().cancelLayout()` which resurrected the worker singleton (and threw in SSR, where `Worker` is undefined) purely to cancel.
- **DOMPortalEntity observer/listeners on `scene.remove()`**: the `ResizeObserver` and DOM event listeners are now managed by `attachDOMBindings()` / `releaseDOMBindings()`. `scene.remove()` (and off-screen portal reconcile) releases them so a detached portal no longer leaks an observer that keeps its element alive and firing; the projection path re-attaches them idempotently if the portal is re-added, so remove→re-add still works.
- **Streaming Markdown**: `setContent()` and `updateTokens()` now `destroy()` discarded blocks (freeing each block's subtree resources) instead of only detaching them, and a new `Markdown.destroy()` drops this instance's in-flight worker callbacks (each pinned the whole entity via its closure) before recursing the content subtree.
- **ComputeParticleEntity**: no code change needed — the `Entity.destroy()` recursion already frees nested particle GPU buffers; added a regression test proving a nested particle subtree's buffers are all released.
